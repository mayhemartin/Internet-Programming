    Regarding the project, here is a <u>broken link: </u><a href="somePageThatDoesntExistButCouldExistIfItWasMade.aspx"><b>Try Me</b></a> hehe, Visual Studio is telling me that that page doesn't exist.&nbsp; 
    <br />
    Or perhaps a <u>Forbidden Link:</u><a href="Reports.aspx"><b>Try Me Again</b></a> 
    (<i>Incorrect Implementation</i>)<br />
<br />
There should be user control, though not via asp&#39;s LoginView, there are multiple 
databases, the database creation script is available, and the connection string 
is stored in the webconfig file.</span>&nbsp;
